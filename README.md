# Chess AI Project

## Overview

This project implements a chess AI using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with self-play reinforcement learning. The AI is designed to learn and improve its gameplay by playing against itself, leveraging the `python-chess` library for chess logic and the `PyTorch` framework for building and training the neural network.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- python-chess
